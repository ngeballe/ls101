Question 4

The Ruby Array class has several methods for removing items from the array. Two of them have very similar names. Let's see how they differ:

    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

What does the follow method calls do (assume we reset numbers to the original array between method calls)?

    numbers.delete_at(1)
    numbers.delete(1)


Answer: 
    numbers.delete_at(1) deletes the element at position 1 in the array, which is the number 2 (since the array starts with the 0th element). The method call will return the number that it deletes. The new value of numbers will be [1, 3, 4, 5]. 

    numbers.delete(1) deletes the element 1 from the array wherever it appears (which in this case is just once, in position 0). It returns what it deletes: 1. The new value of numbers will be [2, 3, 4, 5].
