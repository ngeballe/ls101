# Question 6

# One day Spot was playing with the Munster family's home computer and he wrote a small program to mess with their demographic data:

munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

def mess_with_demographics(demo_hash)
  demo_hash.values.each do |family_member|
    family_member["age"] += 42
    family_member["gender"] = "other"
  end
end

# After writing this method, he typed the following...and before Grandpa could stop him, he hit the Enter key with his tail:

mess_with_demographics(munsters)

# Did the family's data get ransacked, or did the mischief only mangle a local copy of the original hash? (why?)

# Prediction: It only sampled a local copy, because the method iterates through the new array object demo_hash.values, not demo_hash.

p munsters # => {"Herman"=>{"age"=>74, "gender"=>"other"}, "Lily"=>{"age"=>72, "gender"=>"other"}, "Grandpa"=>{"age"=>444, "gender"=>"other"}, "Eddie"=>{"age"=>52, "gender"=>"other"}, "Marilyn"=>{"age"=>65, "gender"=>"other"}}

# No, it did actually ransack the data
