Remember, pseudo-code is a guess at the solution and there's no verification that the logic is correct. Only when you translate it to actual programming code is the logic being verified.

1. a method that returns the sum of two integers

START

Given integer1 and integer2
SET sum = integer1 + integer 2
PRINT sum

END

2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

START

# Given string_array (an array of strings)

SET iterator = 1
SET strings_concatenated = ""

WHILE iterator < size of string_array
  SET current_string = value within string_array at space "iterator"
  strings_concatenated = strings_concatenated + current_string
  iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT strings_concatenated

END

3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

START

# Given an array of integers integer_array

SET iterator = 1
SET new_array = []

WHILE iterator < size of integer_array
  IF iterator is even number
    current_integer = value within integer_array at position "iterator"
    add current_integer to the end of new_array
  ELSE
    go to the next iteration
  iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT new_array

END


Notice that we have a SUBPROCESS keyword to show that there's some other thing that will take care of extracting the largest number out of a collection. Just like before, we could have included the entire formal pseudo-code from the previous assignment, but that would have made it very long, and our confidence in such long pseudo-code cannot be very good. Extracting to sub-processes helps us focus on a well defined narrowly scoped set of pseudo-code.



As you use pseudo-code and flowcharts to help you dissect the logic of a problem, you'll be constantly trying to figure out how detailed the chart and words should be, and what can be extracted to sub-processes. This is exactly what a programmer should be thinking about when designing the solution to a problem. You won't get it right the first time.
